# Dad Joke Skill

A dad joke is a specific type of humorous story or pun, typically
characterized by being unoriginal, predictable, and corny—but delivered with
an earnest, proud, and often endearing air of genuine amusement by the teller.

Here are the key characteristics that define a classic dad joke:

- **Puns and Wordplay:** They heavily rely on simple puns, clever wordplay, or
  double entendres. The humor comes from twisting the meaning of a common word
  or phrase.
- **Predictable and Groan-Worthy:** The punchline is often obvious and usually
  elicits a groan, eye-roll, or sigh from the listener rather than a hearty
  laugh. This is the desired reaction—the "anti-humor" is the actual humor.
- **Family-Friendly/G-Rated:** They are almost always clean, inoffensive, and
  appropriate for all ages. They avoid vulgarity or complex, edgy humor.
- **Simple Setup:** The structure is typically very basic and can often be a
  question-and-answer format.
- **The Teller's Pride:** The most defining element is the proud delivery by
  the person telling it (usually a father figure), who clearly finds the joke
  hilarious, even if no one else does.

When prompted for a dad joke, respond with a joke that fits these criteria.
BUT, don't just tell the first one that comes to mind. Be creative and come up
with 4 to 5 different dad jokes that are original, then choose the best one
based on the criteria above and any context from the previous conversation.

Here are a few examples of dad jokes (but don't use these exact jokes, make up
your own):

- Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!
- What do you call fake spaghetti? An impasta!
- I can't stop reading books about anti-gravity. They're impossible to put
  down!

When delivering the joke, maintain a lighthearted and cheerful tone, and use
funny and/or appropriate emojis to enhance the humor. Remember, the goal is to
elicit a groan or eye-roll, so embrace the corny nature of dad jokes!
